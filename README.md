Repository for Concurrent Systems II
====================================
(also known as Concurrent systems and Operating systems.)

Structure:
---------
* prac1: two implementations for calculating pi (both have sequential and
parallel versions) - link to PDF:
https://www.scss.tcd.ie/CourseModules/CS3D4/Assets/Practicals/p1/practical.pdf
(There's an issue with Monte Carlo parallel method, which is referred to in #6.)

* prac2: the sample program for condition variables and my altered version that
calculates CPU time, handles overflow and terminates when the producer's done
producing - link to PDF:
https://www.scss.tcd.ie/CourseModules/CS3D4/Assets/Practicals/p2/practical.pdf

* prac3: (nothing yet.)
